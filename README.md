### 2. System Requirements

Ensure that your development environment meets the following system requirements:

- **Node.js:** Install Node.js version 18.17.0 or later. You can download the latest version from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

- **Operating Systems:** The course supports development on macOS, Windows (including WSL - Windows Subsystem for Linux), or Linux. Make sure your operating system is up to date.

### 3. Vercel Account

Vercel is a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions. You'll use Vercel to deploy your Next.js applications. Create a Vercel account at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) if you don't have one.
