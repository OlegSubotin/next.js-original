# Next.js Course

Welcome to the Next.js course! Before you begin, make sure you have a good understanding of the following topics and have the necessary tools set up.

## Prerequisites

### 1. JavaScript Fundamentals

A strong foundation in JavaScript is essential, as both React and Next.js heavily rely on it. Make sure you are comfortable with JavaScript concepts such as variables, functions, arrays, and objects.

### 2. React Basics

Since Next.js is a framework built on top of React, it's crucial to have a solid understanding of React fundamentals. If you're not familiar with React, consider taking a React basics course or reviewing the official React documentation.

### 3. System Requirements

Ensure that your development environment meets the following system requirements:

- **Node.js:** Install Node.js version 18.17.0 or later. You can download the latest version from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

- **Operating Systems:** The course supports development on macOS, Windows (including WSL - Windows Subsystem for Linux), or Linux. Make sure your operating system is up to date.

### 4. Vercel Account

Vercel is a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions. You'll use Vercel to deploy your Next.js applications. Create a Vercel account at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) if you don't have one.

### 5. Version Control with Git

A basic understanding of Git is essential. If you're new to Git, familiarize yourself with basic commands and workflows.

### 6. GitHub Account

You'll need a GitHub account to manage your repositories and deploy your application. If you don't have an account, you can create one on the [GitHub website](https://github.com/).
